- Explain the development of random testers.
	- Improvements in coverage.
	- Efforts to check correctness by breaking the code.

- Discuss how much cards manage to cover.
	- Was there code failed to cover? Why?

- For at least one card, tester achieve 100% 
  statement and branch coverage.
	- Document this.
		- How long did test had to run? 
		  (No more that 5 mins)

- Compare coverage to unit tests.
	- Discuss tests differ in ability to detect faults
	- Which test had higher coverage? Unit or random?
