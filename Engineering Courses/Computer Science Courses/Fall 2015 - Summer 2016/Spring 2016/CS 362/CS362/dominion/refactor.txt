1) Created basic structure for five empty functions.
2) Named functions depending on five chosen cards to refactor.
3) Copied and pasted each card's code from switch statement into
   their defined functions.
4) Determined and re-typed what each funtion is returning.
5) Call each of the five cards' functions in the switch statement
   in the cardEffect function.
6) Determined and then declared funtions parameters, along with
   determining and declaring each individual funtion's extra
   variables needed.
7) Determined which arguments each function will need to preform
   within their own functions to pass.
8) Added needed return statements in the switch case in the 
   cardEffect function.

9) Added incorrect logic.
