- Discuss unit testing efforts

First off it came to creating the basic format/funtions
for each unit test file within my directory.
Then I had to personlize each test by choosing certian
funtions to test in dominion.c.

I ran out of time before midnight of the due date.
I was unable to see if my files complied of the program.
But some of the tests were writtened completed without
actually using them by testing them.

Predicting that if I had the chance to complie my unit
tests on time, I may find issues/bugs in the original code,
or even in my unit tests themselves.. 
Predicting it would have come to more of a trial and 
error type of situation overall.

I learned that I really need to improve on my time
management skills, in order to complete these
assignments. I will complete this assignment eventually,
soon, even I did not complete it on time.
