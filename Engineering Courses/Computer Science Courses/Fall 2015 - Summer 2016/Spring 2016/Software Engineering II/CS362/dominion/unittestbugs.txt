I ran out of time and limited resources to actually
run my unit tests.
I would predict that my tests would at least call each
of the chosen funtions once, possible not covering a
whole lot initially when the game is ran.

I learned that I really need to improve on my time
management skills, in order to complete these
assignments. I will complete this assignment eventually,
soon, even I did not complete it on time.
