Block and Character
\par
Block devices and character devices implement I/O differently. Block devices include disk drives which implement commands that can read, write, and seek. Character devices include a more simpler user interface, and use such commands like get and put. Such devices that would characterize as character devices would include keyboards, mice, and serial ports. [1]
