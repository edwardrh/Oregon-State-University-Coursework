- One single file, mypython.py
- When executed:
	- Create 3 files in the same directory of script
		- Different Names (up to you!)
		- Remains in directory even after execution
		- Contain exactly 10 random characters,
			from lowercase alphabet, no spaces
			(i.e. "hoehdgwkdq")
		- The eleventh character should be a newline character
	- Print out the contents of the 3 files
